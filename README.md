  <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Ivan's Journey to become a Data Analyst</h3></summary>
 
My journey to becoming a data analyst has been defined by my quest to acquire essential knowledge and skills, along with the guidance of my mentor. I possess an analytical mindset and a natural aptitude for problem-solving, complemented by my Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics. Recognizing the significance of Python as the most in-demand programming language in data analysis, I dedicated myself to acquiring an intermediate skill level in Python. I have also gained knowledge in relevant data cleaning, processing, and modeling packages. Understanding the value of Excel in data analysis and visualization, I expanded my skill set by taking it as an elective course. In pursuing personal and professional growth, I completed a data analytics internship course and received a certificate of completion. As a demonstration of my abilities, I developed a predictive model for Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) fatty liver disease as my undergrad thesis. This project showcased my expertise in applying advanced statistical techniques to real-world scenarios. These diverse experiences have provided me with a strong foundation as a Data Analyst, equipping me with the necessary abilities and practical knowledge to succeed in the industry.
