My journey to acquiring the essential knowledge and skills, and the proper guidance of my suitable mentor, has been a defining aspect of my quest to become a data analyst.
I possess an analytical mindset and a natural aptitude for problem-solving, complemented by attaining a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics. Recognizing Python's significance as the most in demand programming language in this field, I obtained an intermediate skill for it and have knowledge in relevant data cleaning, processing, and modeling packages. I developed a predictive model for Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) fatty liver disease to demonstrate my abilities. This project showcased my expertise in applying advanced statistical techniques to real-world scenarios. Continuing my pursuit of growth, I completed a data analytics internship course and received a certificate of completion. Additionally, I also added Excel to my skill set by taking it as an elective course, as I was aware of its value in data analysis and visualization. These experiences have given me a strong foundation as a Data Analyst and the abilities and practical knowledge I need to succeed in this industry.
