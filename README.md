  <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Ivan's Journey to become a Data Analyst</h3></summary>
 
My journey towards becoming a proficient software engineer and data analyst has been defined by a relentless pursuit of essential knowledge and skills, complemented by the invaluable guidance of my mentor. My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics, which has honed my analytical mindset and innate problem-solving abilities. Recognizing Python's paramount importance as the most sought-after programming language in the realms of software engineering and data analysis, I committed myself to attaining an intermediate level of proficiency in Python. Additionally, I have acquired expertise in relevant data cleaning, processing, and modeling libraries. Understanding the pivotal role of Excel in the context of data analysis and visualization, I further diversified my skill set by enrolling in an elective course dedicated to this tool. To foster both personal and professional growth, I undertook comprehensive courses in data analytics and software engineering successfully earning certificates of completion. As a testament to my capabilities, my undergraduate thesis focused on the development of a predictive model for Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) fatty liver disease. This project served as a demonstration of my proficiency in applying advanced statistical techniques to real-world scenarios. Cumulatively, these diverse experiences have established a sturdy foundation for my career as a data analyst or software engineer, equipping me with the requisite competencies and practical knowledge to excel in these dynamic fields.
